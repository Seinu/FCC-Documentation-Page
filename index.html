        <p>C++ is designed to be a compiled language, meaning that it is generally translated into machine language that can be understood directly by the system, making the generated program highly efficient. For that, a set of tools are needed, known as the development toolchain, whose core are a compiler and its linker.</p>
  
  <p>The easiest way for beginners to compile C++ programs is by using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). An IDE generally integrates several development tools, including a text editor and tools to compile programs directly from it.</p>
  
  <p>Here you have instructions on how to compile and run console programs using different free Integrated Development Interfaces (IDEs)</p>
  
  <li>Code::blocks	Windows/Linux/MacOS</li>
  <li>Visual Studio Express	Windows</li>
  <li>Dev-C++	Windows</li>

      <article>
      <p>C and C++ are fairly similar langauges. When compared to C++, C is a subset of C++. C++ is a superset of C. C++ can run most of C code while C cannot run C++ code.</p>
  
  <p>C supports procedural programming paradigm for code development. C does not support object oriented programming; therefore it has no support for polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance. In C (because it is a procedural programming language), data and functions are separate and free entities.</p>
  <p>C++ supports both procedural and object oriented programming paradigms; therefore C++ is also called a hybrid language. Being an object oriented programming language C++ supports polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance. In C++ (when it is used as object oriented programming language), data and functions are encapsulated together in form of an object. For creating objects class provides a blueprint of structure of the object.</p>

  You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
      </p>

            Fundamental data types are basic types implemented directly by the language that represent the basic storage units supported natively by most systems. They can mainly be classified into:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Character types:</strong> They can represent a single character, such as 'A' or '$'. The most basic type is char, which is a one-byte character. Other types are also provided for wider characters.</li>
        <li><strong>Numerical integer types:</strong> They can store a whole number value, such as 7 or 1024. They exist in a variety of sizes, and can either be signed or unsigned, depending on whether they support negative values or not.</li>
        <li><strong>Floating-point types:</strong> They can represent real values, such as 3.14 or 0.01, with different levels of precision, depending on which of the three floating-point types is used.</li>
        <li><strong>Boolean type:</strong> The boolean type, known in C++ as bool, can only represent one of two states, true or false.</li>

      <header>Introduction to strings</header>
      <article>
       <p> Fundamental types represent the most basic types handled by the machines where the code may run. But one of the major strengths of the C++ language is its rich set of compound types, of which the fundamental types are mere building blocks.</p>
  
       <p>An example of compound type is the string class. Variables of this type are able to store sequences of characters, such as words or sentences. A very useful feature!</p>

  <p>A first difference with fundamental data types is that in order to declare and use objects (variables) of this type, the program needs to include the header where the type is defined within the standard library <code>(header <string>):</code></p>
  <code>// my first string
    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>
    using namespace std;
    
    int main ()
    {
      string mystring;
      mystring = "This is a string";
      cout << mystring;
      return 0;
    }</code>
        <p>As you can see in the previous example, strings can be initialized with any valid string literal, just like numerical type variables can be initialized to any valid numerical literal. As with fundamental types, all initialization formats are valid with strings:</p>
  
  <code>string mystring = "This is a string";
    string mystring ("This is a string");
    string mystring {"This is a string"};</code>
      </article>
      </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
      <header>Constants</header>
      <article>
  <p><strong>Literals</strong> are the most obvious kind of constants. They are used to express particular values within the source code of a program. We have already used some in previous chapters to give specific values to variables or to express messages we wanted our programs to print out, for example, when we wrote:</p>
  
        <code>a = 5;</code>
  <p>The 5 in this piece of code was a literal constant.</p>
  
  <p>Literal constants can be classified into: integer, floating-point, characters, strings, Boolean, pointers, and user-defined literals.</p>
  <strong>Integer Numerals</strong>
  <code>1776
    707
    -273</code>
  <p>These are numerical constants that identify integer values. Notice that they are not enclosed in quotes or any other special character; they are a simple succession of digits representing a whole number in decimal base; for example, 1776 always represents the value one thousand seven hundred seventy-six.</p>
  
  <p>In addition to decimal numbers (those that most of us use every day), C++ allows the use of octal numbers (base 8) and hexadecimal numbers (base 16) as literal constants. For octal literals, the digits are preceded with a 0 (zero) character. And for hexadecimal, they are preceded by the characters 0x (zero, x). For example, the following literal constants are all equivalent to each other: </p>

  <code>75         // decimal
    0113       // octal
    0x4b       // hexadecimal</code>
  <p>All of these represent the same number: 75 (seventy-five) expressed as a base-10 numeral, octal numeral and hexadecimal numeral, respectively.</p>

    <p>These literal constants have a type, just like variables. By default, integer literals are of type int. However, certain suffixes may be appended to an integer literal to specify a different integer type:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>u or U	unsigned</li>
      <li>l or L	long</li>
      <li>ll or LL	long long</li>
    </ul>

  <code>75         // int
    75u        // unsigned int
    75l        // long
    75ul       // unsigned long 
    75lu       // unsigned long</code>

    <strong>Floating Point Numerals</strong>
    <p>They express real values, with decimals and/or exponents. They can include either a decimal point, an e character (that expresses "by ten at the Xth height", where X is an integer value that follows the e character), or both a decimal point and an e character:</p>
    <code>3.14159    // 3.14159
      6.02e23    // 6.02 x 10^23
      1.6e-19    // 1.6 x 10^-19
      3.0        // 3.0 </code>

      <p>These are four valid numbers with decimals expressed in C++. The first number is PI, the second one is the number of Avogadro, the third is the electric charge of an electron (an extremely small number) -all of them approximated-, and the last one is the number three expressed as a floating-point numeric literal.</p>

      <p>The default type for floating-point literals is double. Floating-point literals of type float or long double can be specified by adding one of the following suffixes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>f or F	float</li>
      <li>l or L	long double</li>
    </ul>

  <code>3.14159L   // long double
    6.02e23f   // float</code>

    <p>Any of the letters that can be part of a floating-point numerical constant (e, f, l) can be written using either lower or uppercase letters with no difference in meaning.</p>
    <strong>Character and string literals</strong>
    <p>Character and string literals are enclosed in quotes:</p>
    <code>'z'
      'p'
      "Hello world"
      "How do you do?"</code>
      <p>The first two expressions represent single-character literals, and the following two represent string literals composed of several characters. Notice that to represent a single character, we enclose it between single quotes ('), and to express a string (which generally consists of more than one character), we enclose the characters between double quotes (").</p>
      <p><strong>Typed constant expressions</strong>Sometimes, it is just convenient to give a name to a constant value. We can then use these names instead of the literals they were defined to:</p>

      <code>#include <iostream>
        using namespace std;
        
        const double pi = 3.14159;
        const char newline = '\n';
        
        int main ()
        {
          double r=5.0;               // radius
          double circle;
        
          circle = 2 * pi * r;
          cout << circle;
          cout << newline;
        }</code>
      </article>
      </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
      <header>if...else statement</header>
      <article>
  <p>The if keyword is used to execute a statement or block, if, and only if, a condition is fulfilled. Its syntax is:</p>
  
  <code>if (condition) statement</code>

  <p>Here, condition is the expression that is being evaluated. If this condition is true, statement is executed. If it is false, statement is not executed (it is simply ignored), and the program continues right after the entire selection statement.
    For example, the following code fragment prints the message (x is 100), only if the value stored in the x variable is indeed 100:</p>

    <code>if (x == 100)
      cout << "x is 100";</code>
  
      <p>If x is not exactly 100, this statement is ignored, and nothing is printed.</p>
      <p>If you want to include more than a single statement to be executed when the condition is fulfilled, these statements shall be enclosed in braces ({}), forming a block:</p>
  
  <code>if (x == 100)
    {
       cout << "x is ";
       cout << x;
    }</code>
  
    <p>Selection statements with if can also specify what happens when the condition is not fulfilled, by using the else keyword to introduce an alternative statement. Its syntax is:</p>
    <code>if (condition) statement1 else statement2</code>

    <p>where statement1 is executed in case condition is true, and in case it is not, statement2 is executed.

      For example:</p>
    
  <code>if (x == 100)
    cout << "x is 100";
  else
    cout << "x is not 100";</code>
  <p>This prints x is 100, if indeed x has a value of 100, but if it does not, and only if it does not, it prints x is not 100 instead.
    Several if + else structures can be concatenated with the intention of checking a range of values. For example:</p>

    <code>if (x > 0)
      cout << "x is positive";
    else if (x < 0)
      cout << "x is negative";
    else
      cout << "x is 0";</code>
  <p>This prints whether x is positive, negative, or zero by concatenating two if-else structures. Again, it would have also been possible to execute more than a single statement per case by grouping them into blocks enclosed in braces: {}.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
      <header>while statement</header>
      <article>
  <p>The simplest kind of loop is the while-loop. Its syntax is:</p>
  
  <code>while (expression) statement</code>
   
  <p>The while-loop simply repeats statement while expression is true. If, after any execution of statement, expression is no longer true, the loop ends, and the program continues right after the loop. For example, let's have a look at a countdown using a while-loop:</p>

  <code>// custom countdown using while
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    
    int main ()
    {
      int n = 10;
    
      while (n>0) {
        cout << n << ", ";
        --n;
      }
    
      cout << "liftoff!\n";
    }</code>

    <p>The first statement in main sets n to a value of 10. This is the first number in the countdown. Then the while-loop begins: if this value fulfills the condition n>0 (that n is greater than zero), then the block that follows the condition is executed, and repeated for as long as the condition (n>0) remains being true.</p>
  
    <p>The whole process of the previous program can be interpreted according to the following script (beginning in main):</p>
  
    <ol>
      <li>n is assigned a value</li>
      <li>The while condition is checked (n>0). At this point there are two possibilities:
        <ul>
          <li>condition is true: the statement is executed (to step 3)</li>
          <li>condition is false: ignore statement and continue after it (to step 5)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Execute statement:<code>cout << n << ", ";
        --n;</code>
        (prints the value of n and decreases n by 1)</li>
        <li>End of block. Return automatically to step 2</li>
        <li>Continue the program right after the block:
          print liftoff! and end the program.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      A thing to consider with while-loops is that the loop should end at some point, and thus the statement shall alter values checked in the condition in some way, so as to force it to become false at some point. Otherwise, the loop will continue looping forever. In this case, the loop includes --n, that decreases the value of the variable that is being evaluated in the condition (n) by one - this will eventually make the condition (n>0) false after a certain number of loop iterations. To be more specific, after 10 iterations, n becomes 0, making the condition no longer true, and ending the while-loop.

    <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
      <header>Function declarations</header>
      <article> 
  <p>Functions allow to structure programs in segments of code to perform individual tasks.</p>
  <p>In C++, a function is a group of statements that is given a name, and which can be called from some point of the program. The most common syntax to define a function is:</p>

  <code>
    type name ( parameter1, parameter2, ...) { statements }</code>

    Where:
    <ul>
<li>type is the type of the value returned by the function.</li>
<li>name is the identifier by which the function can be called.</li>
<li>parameters (as many as needed): Each parameter consists of a type followed by an identifier, with each parameter being separated from the next by a comma. Each parameter looks very much like a regular variable declaration (for example: int x), and in fact acts within the function as a regular variable which is local to the function. The purpose of parameters is to allow passing arguments to the function from the location where it is called from.</li>
<li>statements is the function's body. It is a block of statements surrounded by braces { } that specify what the function actually does.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Let's have a look at an example:</p>
  <code>// function example
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    
    int addition (int a, int b)
    {
      int r;
      r=a+b;
      return r;
    }
    
    int main ()
    {
      int z;
      z = addition (5,3);
      cout << "The result is " << z;
    }</code>
  <p>This program is divided in two functions: addition and main. Remember that no matter the order in which they are defined, a C++ program always starts by calling main. In fact, main is the only function called automatically, and the code in any other function is only executed if its function is called from main (directly or indirectly).
      </p>
  <p>In the example above, main begins by declaring the variable z of type int, and right after that, it performs the first function call: it calls addition. The call to a function follows a structure very similar to its declaration. In the example above, the call to addition can be compared to its definition just a few lines earlier:</p>
